# **4Dev Flutter - Polls for Programmers**

This application is part of the training of Professor Rodrigo Manguinho (Mango) on Udemy.

The objective of the training is to show how to create an application with Flutter using a well-defined and decoupled architecture, following TDD (test-oriented programming) as a working methodology, Clean Architecture to distribute responsibilities in layers, always following the principles of SOLID and applying Design Patterns to solve some common problems.
